# Flocking-Simulation
Flocking simulation of starling murmuration using Javascript.

## Definitions

#### Flocking behavior
Flocking is a the motion of birds together and flocking behavior is a type of behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are in flight.

#### Starling mumuration
Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. It is known as murmuration, when a huge flocks of starling in migration form shape-shifting flight patterns. A good example is shown below -
