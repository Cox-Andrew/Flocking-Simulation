# Flocking-Simulation
Flocking simulation of starling murmuration using Javascript.

## Definitions

#### Flocking behavior
Flocking is a the motion of birds together and flocking behavior is a type of behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are in flight.

#### Starling mumuration
Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. It is known as murmuration, when a huge flocks of starling in migration form shape-shifting flight patterns. A good example is shown below -

## Prey-Predator Concept

**Prey = Starlings** 

**Predator = Peregrine Falcon**

## Running locally

- install npm
- install http-server (or similar package)
- run the http-server from the folder where the script is located
- Go the local server claimed by http-server

For linux users the terminal commands are as follows-

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install http-server -g
http-server -c-1

```
