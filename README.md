# Flocking-Simulation
Flocking simulation of starling murmuration using web graphics library(webGL) and openGL shader language in javascript.

#### Flocking behavior
Flocking is a the motion of birds together and flocking behavior is a type of behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are in flight.

#### Starling mumuration
Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. It is known as murmuration, when a huge flocks of starling in migration form shape-shifting flight patterns. A good example is shown below - 


## Folders usage

#### js-libs
The static javascript library files from three.js and soome from webGL-js.

#### shader
Shader programs are the ones that are compiled in graphical processing unit.

#### css
Used CSS stylesheets in the markup code.

#### img
Images that shall be used in the front-end code.

## Running locally

- install npm
- install http-server (or similar package)
- run the http-server from the folder where the script is located
- Go the local server claimed by http-server

For linux users the terminal commands are as follows-

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install http-server -g
http-server -c-1

```

or 

Just run the `index.html` file, embedding the javascript files in it.
